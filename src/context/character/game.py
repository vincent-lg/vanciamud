"""Default context for logged-in characters.

This context is responsible for handling commands, exits and channels.
It always is the default context in the character's command stack
and cannot be entirely removed, though other contexts can be added
and they can "block" user input to make sure it is not sent to the game
context at all.

Note:
    This context can seem close to the "connection.game" context,
    yet the two are really different: the "connection.game" context
    forwards to the character's command stack.  The "character.game"
    context, on the other hand, is the default active context on
    the context stack: therefore, user input is, by default, forwarded
    from "connection.game" to "character.game", but it is possible
    to add new contexts on the character's context stack.  The
    "character.game" context is always available to the context
    stack, but another context might be active at the time.
